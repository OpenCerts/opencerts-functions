# OpenAttestation Function

## Verify

The function invokes [@govtechsg/opencerts-verify](https://github.com/OpenCerts/verify) library and returns the result of the verifications performed on the provided document.

To get more information, please refer to:

- [ADR about OpenAttestation verifications](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/verifier.md): The ADR explains in details the whole process for the verification as well as the different terms used.
- [@govtechsg/oa-verify](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-verify): Implementation of OpenAttestation verifier ADR. [@govtechsg/opencerts-verify](https://github.com/OpenCerts/verify) is built on top of this library.
- [@govtechsg/opencerts-verify](https://github.com/OpenCerts/verify): Extension of [@govtechsg/oa-verify](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-verify) providing a new verifier checking issuer identity upon Opencerts registry.

### Usage

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"document":"<OA_DOCUMENT_HERE>"}' \
  https://api.opencerts.io/verify
```

### Response

- `summary` is an object containing the verification for each fragment types as well as the consolidated result.
  - `summary.all` is a boolean indicating whether the document is valid for all fragment types.
  - `summary.documentStatus` is a boolean indicating whether the document is valid for fragment with `DOCUMENT_STATUS` type.
  - `summary.documentIntegrity` is a boolean indicating whether the document is valid for fragment with `DOCUMENT_INTEGRITY` type.
  - `summary.issuerIdentity` is a boolean indicating whether the document is valid for fragment with `ISSUER_IDENTITY` type.
- `data` is an array containing the fragments returned by all the verifiers that ran over the provided document.

```json

    "all": true,

## Email

This function sends email on behalf of OpenCerts user to another recipient. This function is for OpenCerts documents only.

Example (with captcha):

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"to": "someone@example.com", "captcha": "<CAPTCHA_SECRET>", "certificate":"<OA_DOCUMENT_HERE>"}' \
  https://api.opencerts.io/email
```

Example (with API KEY):

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"to": "someone@example.com", "X-API-KEY": "<API_KEY>", "certificate":"<OA_DOCUMENT_HERE>"}' \
  https://api.opencerts.io/email
```

## Storage

This service exists to provide transient file storage to facilitate transmission via QR codes or hyperlinks.
The OpenAttestation file is received and then encrypted by the server with a randomly generated decryption key.
This decryption key is returned to the API caller, along with the other necessary decryption parameters.

Files have a default expiration date of 31 days from upload, after which it will be permanently deleted from storage and made irretrievable.

**This service currently has a limitation where uploaded files must be < 6MB, due to AWS Lambda payload limit**

#### Examples

###### Uploading a document with API key

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.opencerts.io/storage \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: kNb15YYZ6N1zBlYd25cjj8PLgK6YAuvN9Gf7fPM1' \
  --data '{
	"document": {
  "schema": "opencerts/v2.0",
  "data": { ... },
  "privacy": {},
  "signature": {
    "type": "SHA3MerkleProof",
    "targetHash": "cbd224a72af5e0050bd58ab2264094cbacac0f19f7f430e347cad451ae8c590d",
    "proof": [],
    "merkleRoot": "cbd224a72af5e0050bd58ab2264094cbacac0f19f7f430e347cad451ae8c590d"
  }
}
}'
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "id": "3f52945e-c3f1-4169-b170-29f0166e67ec",
  "key": "034d406a166786c29cb060b0eaba145ec824ceb1391e7dbb651dfe87d5fde0b1",
  "type": "OPEN-ATTESTATION-TYPE-1",
  "ttl": 1595397805611
}
```
Which means the file has been successfully uploaded and can be retrieved from https://api.opencerts.io/storage/3f52945e-c3f1-4169-b170-29f0166e67ec and decrypted using the given key.

###### Retrieving an uploaded file

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.opencerts.io/storage/23ed66b3-464f-4cae-9e59-3af3be8ce604
```

Will return

```json
{
  "document": {
    "cipherText": "twETH8OSgv5lOcj6J8jIcn7/CC...",
    "iv": "Qq+uDpAs4CbMpZRs",
    "tag": "ghT8WP0PxMm58oHzzdqD9w==",
    "type": "OPEN-ATTESTATION-TYPE-1",
    "ttl": 1595390482411
  }
}
```

This content can be decrypted using the [OpenAttestation encryption library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@govtechsg/oa-encryption)


#### Configuration

###### File Expiration
To configure the file expiration duration, please set the environment variable `OBJECT_TTL` to an integer value with the number of days. For example, `7`.

###### Access Control
To enable access control of uploading documents via API keys, please set the environment variable `ENABLE_STORAGE_UPLOAD_API_KEY` to `true`
This option is disabled by default. This access control does not include the GET function, as the document is already encrypted. Any retrieved data is unusable without the decryption key.

Upon deployment, the API key is automatically generated by AWS and printed in the console output as such:
```
...
api keys:
  stg-storage-api-key: kNb15YYZ6N1zBlYd25cjj8PLgK6YAuvN9Gf7fPM1
...
```


# Development

Copy `.env` from a co-worker or insert own credentials to get started. A copy of the .env file is available at `.env.example`

```
npm run dev
```

To run local tests against dynamodb-local, run commands

`npm run dev` to start the local database

`npm run integration:local` to run the tests

Note that a number of dev deps have been removed because they are unmaintained and are listed here:

```
"serverless-s3-local": "^0.8.1"
```

## Dynamodb

The development environment uses [serverless-dynamodb-local](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-dynamodb-local) to emulate the dynamodb in AWS.

Install dynamodb locally

```
sls dynamodb install
```

Start dynamodb

```
sls dynamodb start
```
